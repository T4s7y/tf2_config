## TF2 Config

My tf2 config that helped manage 60fps on my old potato laptop.<br>
If you don't like your game looking like it was made for the PS2 skip the autoexec folder.<br>
Feel free to change the key binds inside the class-specific configs as you desire.<br>

## Installation

To install copy the `.cfg` file you desire inside your `tf/cfg/` directory found inside the game's local files.


If you're using mastercomfig create a subfolder called `overrides` inside the `tf/cfg/` directory and copy the files there.
